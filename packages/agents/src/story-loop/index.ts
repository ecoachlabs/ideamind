/**
 * Story Loop Phase (Phase 8)
 *
 * Sequential implementation phase where user stories are converted to code.
 * Unlike previous phases, this phase processes stories SEQUENTIALLY, running
 * all 3 agents for each story before moving to the next.
 *
 * Agents:
 * - StoryCoderAgent: Implements user stories with production code
 * - CodeReviewerAgent: Reviews code quality, security, and performance
 * - UnitTestWriterAgent: Generates comprehensive tests with 80%+ coverage
 *
 * Pattern: For each user story: Code → Review → Tests
