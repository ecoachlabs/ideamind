## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### For Developers

**Enable Knowledge Map in your coordinator**:
```typescript
import { PRDCoordinator } from '@ideamine/orchestrator-core';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const dbPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});

const coordinator = new PRDCoordinator({
  enableKnowledgeMap: true,
  enableRefinery: true,
  dbPool,
  knowledgeMapConnectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});
```

**Use management tools**:
```typescript
import {
  KMQueryTool,
  KMCarryOverManager,
  KMResolveTool,
} from '@ideamine/orchestrator-core/knowledge-map';

const queryTool = new KMQueryTool(dbPool);
const results = await queryTool.queryByText({
  searchText: 'target latency',
  phase: 'PRD',
});
```

### For DevOps/Platform Teams

**Deploy to production**:
```bash
# 1. Apply database schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -f packages/tool-sdk/src/db/knowledge-map-schema.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f packages/tool-sdk/src/db/knowledge-map-refinery-extensions.sql

# 2. Build application
npm run build --workspaces

# 3. Deploy (see KNOWLEDGE_MAP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

# 4. Verify
npm run test:integration
```

### For Testing

**Run the test suite**:
```bash
# Set test database
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/ideamine_test

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🔄 System Data Flow

```
Phase N-1 Completes
     │
     ├─> Unresolved questions stored with status='open' or 'partial'
     │
Phase N Starts
     │
     ├─> Step 0: Load carry-over questions from Phase N-1
     │   └─> Filter by priority ≥ 0.5, limit 50
     │
     ├─> Step 1-3: Generate Q/A (QAQ/QAA aware of carry-overs)
     │
     ├─> Step 4: Pair questions with answers
     │
     ├─> Step 5: VALIDATE with contradiction detection
     │   ├─> For each Q/A pair:
     │   │   ├─> Run ContradictionScanTool
     │   │   │   └─> Query existing KM for conflicts
     │   │   │       └─> Return consistency: 0.0 or 1.0
     │   │   └─> LLM validation (override consistency score)
     │   │       └─> Accept or reject binding
     │
     ├─> Step 6: Refinery (optional 12-stage pipeline)
     │
     ├─> Step 7: Persist to Knowledge Map
     │   └─> Insert questions, answers, bindings
     │       └─> Create KM nodes for accepted bindings
     │
     └─> Step 8: Update question statuses
         ├─> Mark resolved if answer accepted
         ├─> Mark partial if answer exists but not accepted
         └─> Mark carry-over questions that were resolved
```

## 💡 Key Features Explained

### Carry-Over Logic
Ensures important questions don't get lost as projects move through phases.

**Example**:
- PRD phase: "What is the target latency?" (unanswered)
- BIZDEV phase: Loads question → generates answer → marks resolved
- Result: Complete knowledge, no gaps

### Contradiction Detection
Prevents conflicting information from entering the Knowledge Map.

**Example**:
- Existing: "Target latency < 500ms"
- New answer: "Target latency < 100ms"
- System: Detects conflict → rejects → logs for manual resolution
- Result: Consistent knowledge base

### Management Tools
Provides programmatic access to query, supersede, and resolve knowledge.

**Use Cases**:
- Search for existing answers before generating new ones
- Update outdated knowledge by superseding with newer information
- Resolve conflicts when multiple valid answers exist
