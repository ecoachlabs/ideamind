## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement

IdeaMine is an autonomous software development platform that transforms raw ideas into production-ready software through a fully orchestrated, AI-powered development lifecycle. By combining intelligent orchestration, multi-agent collaboration, and comprehensive quality gates, IdeaMine delivers what traditionally requires months of human effort in days—while maintaining enterprise-grade quality, security, and compliance standards.

**Mission:** Enable anyone to submit an idea and receive a fully-tested, production-ready application within days—without writing code or managing infrastructure.

### Problem Statement

#### Current State Pain Points

Modern software development faces a fundamental productivity paradox: despite advances in tooling, frameworks, and AI-assisted coding, the idea-to-production timeline remains stubbornly long (6-12 months for MVPs) and resource-intensive (5-10 FTE).

**Critical Challenges:**

1. **Idea-to-Production Gap**: 80% of software ideas never reach production due to resource constraints, planning overhead, and execution complexity
2. **Development Velocity**: Traditional SDLC requires 6-12 months for MVP delivery with teams of 5-10 engineers
3. **Quality vs. Speed Trade-off**: Accelerated development compromises testing, documentation, security reviews, and architectural rigor
4. **Inconsistent Execution**: Human variability leads to missing requirements, architectural shortcuts, inadequate testing, and technical debt
5. **Resource Inefficiency**: Engineering talent consumed by repetitive tasks (boilerplate, config, scaffolding, routine testing)
6. **Knowledge Silos**: Critical context loss between handoffs (product → design → engineering → QA → ops)
7. **Lengthy ideation-to-code cycles** (2-6 months typical)
8. **Incomplete requirements** leading to rework (30-40% of dev time)
9. **Security and compliance gaps** discovered late in cycle
10. **Manual testing bottlenecks** causing release delays
11. **Poor feedback integration** resulting in unaddressed user issues

#### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** $850B global software development market (2025)
- Growth Rate: 11% CAGR through 2030

### 2. Agents

**Purpose:** Think and decide within scope using Analyzer-inside-Agent pattern.

#### Analyzer-inside-Agent Pattern

```
Input → Planner → Analyzer → Executor → Verifier → Recorder → Output
```

**Components:**

1. **Planner**: Decomposes task into sub-tasks, identifies required tools
2. **Analyzer**: Decides which tools to invoke based on Value-of-Information (VOI) scoring
3. **Executor**: Invokes tools and processes results
4. **Verifier**: Validates outputs against acceptance criteria
5. **Recorder**: Captures decision rationale, tool usage, and artifacts

#### Value-of-Information (VOI) Scoring

**Formula:**
```
VOI Score = (expected_quality_improvement × utility_weight) - (cost + latency_penalty + risk_penalty)
```

**Decision Logic:**
- Agent decides: **invoke tool** if VOI > threshold
- **Skip tool** if marginal benefit
- Tool policies: per-agent allowlists, budget caps, confidence thresholds

**Example Implementation:**
```python
async def analyzer(plan, result, input):
    conf = await self.evals.selfConfidence(result)  # 0..1
    if conf >= policy.min_confidence_no_tool:
        return { useTool: False, rationale: "High confidence" }

    klass = await self.classify(plan, result)  # e.g. "api-spec"
    candidates = await registry.search({ tags: [klass] })

    scored = candidates
        .filter(c => policy.allowlist.includes(c.id))
        .map(c => ({
            c,
            score: c.estBenefit - (c.estCost + c.latency_penalty + c.risk)
        }))
        .sort((a,b) => b.score - a.score)

    if !scored.length or scored[0].score < policy.min_score_to_invoke:
        return { useTool: False, rationale: "No tool improves enough" }

    return { useTool: True, toolId: scored[0].c.id, rationale: `VOI ${scored[0].score}` }
```

gate:
  id: "prd-gate"
  phase: "PRD"
  checks:
    - name: "minimum_user_stories"
      type: "count"
      threshold: 50
      required: true
    - name: "acceptance_criteria_coverage"
      type: "percentage"
      threshold: 100
      required: true

    parameters:
      projectId: "${event.projectId}"
  filters:
    - "event.status == 'pending'"
  rateLimit:
    maxPerHour: 100
```

- Applies backoff to prevent thrashing
- Escalates to human after N restart attempts
- Preserves state and partial results
- Logs restart rationale for debugging

**Supervisor Configuration:**
```yaml
supervisor:
  checkInterval: 60000 # 1 minute
  stuckThreshold: 600000 # 10 minutes no progress
  restartStrategy: "checkpoint"
  maxRestarts: 3
  escalationChannel: "slack://ops-team"
  metrics:
    - workflow_duration

**Recorded Data:**
- Every tool invocation: inputs, outputs, duration, cost
- Every agent decision: rationale, VOI scores, tool selections
- Every gate evaluation: checks, results, approvals
- Every artifact: version, content hash, metadata
- Every event: timestamp, actor, action, outcome

**Audit Log Schema:**
```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  projectId: string;
  phase: string;
  actor: { type: 'orchestrator' | 'agent' | 'tool' | 'human'; id: string };
  action: string;
  inputs: object;
  outputs: object;
  metadata: {
    duration: number;
    cost: number;
    success: boolean;
    errorMessage?: string;
  };
  traceId: string; // for distributed tracing
}
```

## Hallucination Guards & Quality Mechanisms

### Dedicated Hallucination Guard Tools (16+)

**1. Evidence Retrieval Tools:**
- `citationChecker`: Verifies all factual claims have sources
- `sourceValidator`: Confirms source URLs are accessible and relevant
- `timelineValidator`: Checks temporal consistency of events
- `statisticValidator`: Verifies numerical claims against authoritative sources

**2. Consistency Checkers:**
- `crossArtifactValidator`: Ensures consistency across PRD, ArchPlan, Code
- `requirementTracer`: Validates all requirements are implemented
- `dependencyChecker`: Detects circular or missing dependencies
- `schemaValidator`: Validates data against TypeScript/JSON schemas

**3. Domain Validators:**
- `apiContractValidator`: Ensures API specs match implementation
- `securityPolicyChecker`: Validates security claims against OWASP
- `performanceClaimValidator`: Verifies performance assertions with benchmarks
- `complianceValidator`: Checks regulatory compliance claims (GDPR, SOC2)

**4. Code-Specific Guards:**
- `syntaxValidator`: Ensures generated code compiles/runs
- `testCoverageChecker`: Validates test coverage claims
- `packageValidator`: Confirms package versions and dependencies exist
- `licenseChecker`: Validates license compatibility

### Global Hallucination Guardrails (9 Principles)

**1. No-Cite, No-Claim Principle**
- All factual assertions must include citations
- Claims without evidence are flagged for verification
- Sources must be recent (within 12 months for tech claims)

**2. Explicit Uncertainty**
- Agents must express confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- Low-confidence outputs trigger additional validation
- Uncertainty quantified in metadata

**3. Multi-Agent Cross-Validation**
- Critical decisions reviewed by multiple agents
- Conflicting outputs trigger human review
- Consensus required for high-impact decisions

**4. Temporal Consistency**
- Timelines checked for logical ordering
- Dependencies validated (can't deploy before code)
- Version compatibility verified

**5. Bounded Creativity**
- Outputs constrained to known patterns and templates
- Novel approaches require explicit justification
- Adherence to industry standards enforced

**6. Traceable Provenance**
- Every artifact links to source materials
- Decision rationale captured in audit logs
- Tool usage tracked with inputs/outputs

**7. Verifiable Outputs**
- Code must compile and pass tests
- Architecture must be implementable
- Financial models must balance

**8. Human-in-the-Loop Escalation**
- Low-confidence outputs escalate to humans
- Novel or risky decisions require approval
- Gate failures trigger human review

**9. Continuous Evaluation**
- Eval harness with golden datasets
- Regression detection for quality drops
- Feedback loop from production outcomes

### Per-Phase Guard Mapping

- Alerts at thresholds (50%, 80%, 95%)
- Hard stop at 100% (requires human approval to continue)
- Budget forecasting based on phase and complexity
- Cost attribution (which agents/tools consumed budget)

**Budget Schema:**
```typescript
interface Budget {
  projectId: string;
  cap: number; // dollars
  consumed: number;
  breakdown: {
    llm: number;
    tools: number;
    infrastructure: number;
  };
  alerts: Array<{

## Risk Assessment & Mitigations

### Critical Risks

#### Risk 1: LLM Cost Overrun

**Description:** Unoptimized agent/tool usage causes per-project costs to exceed $2K, destroying unit economics.

**Impact:** High (business viability)
**Probability:** Medium
**Risk Score:** 8/10

**Mitigations:**
1. **Analyzer Pattern**: Agents use VOI scoring to minimize unnecessary tool calls
2. **Budget Guards**: Hard caps at $500/project with alerts at 50%/80%/95%
3. **Response Caching**: 7-day TTL cache for LLM responses and tool results
4. **Model Tiering**: Use smaller models (Claude Haiku) for low-complexity tasks
5. **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests to reduce API overhead
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time cost dashboards and anomaly detection

**Contingency:** If costs remain high, implement human-in-the-loop approval for high-cost operations.

---

#### Risk 2: Quality Gate Bottlenecks

**Description:** Agents repeatedly fail stage gates, causing projects to stall indefinitely.

**Impact:** High (user experience, platform credibility)
**Probability:** Medium
**Risk Score:** 8/10

**Mitigations:**
1. **Auto-Retries with Feedback**: Agents retry with gatekeeper feedback (max 3 attempts)
2. **Rubric Tuning**: ML-based tuning of gate thresholds based on outcomes
3. **Escalation Path**: Human review after 3 failed attempts
4. **Gate Analytics**: Track pass rates and failure reasons per gate
5. **Agent Improvement**: Continuous eval harness to improve agent quality
6. **Partial Progress**: Allow projects to proceed with warnings (non-critical gates)

**Contingency:** Implement "assisted mode" where humans collaborate with agents to pass gates.

---

#### Risk 3: Tool Execution Security

**Description:** Sandbox escape, data exfiltration, or malicious tool code compromises system or customer data.

**Impact:** Critical (legal, reputational, financial)
**Probability:** Low
**Risk Score:** 7/10

**Mitigations:**
1. **gVisor Sandboxes**: Strong isolation for all tool executions
2. **Network Policies**: Allowlist-only external access, block all by default
3. **Secret Redaction**: Secrets never logged, redacted from error messages
4. **Tool Approval**: Mandatory security review for all new tools
5. **Runtime Monitoring**: Detect anomalous behavior (excessive network, CPU, disk)
6. **Regular Pen-Testing**: Quarterly penetration tests by third-party firm
7. **Least Privilege**: Tools run with minimal permissions, no root access

**Contingency:** Incident response plan with containment, forensics, and notification procedures.

---

#### Risk 4: LLM Hallucination

**Description:** Agents generate incorrect code, requirements, or architectures due to LLM hallucinations.

**Impact:** High (product quality, customer trust)
**Probability:** Medium
**Risk Score:** 7/10

**Mitigations:**
1. **Verification Steps**: Every agent has Verifier component checking outputs
2. **Automated Testing**: Generated code must pass tests before merging
3. **Gatekeepers**: Quality thresholds enforced at stage gates
4. **Eval Harness**: Regression testing with golden datasets
5. **Human Review**: Critical decisions escalated (e.g., architecture, security)
6. **Multi-Agent Validation**: Multiple agents cross-check critical artifacts
7. **Knowledge Graph**: Reference past similar projects for consistency
8. **Hallucination Guards**: 16+ dedicated tools + 9 global guardrails

**Contingency:** Flag high-uncertainty outputs for human review before proceeding.

---

#### Risk 5: Third-Party Dependency Failures

**Description:** LLM API outages, cloud provider issues, or third-party service failures disrupt platform.

**Impact:** Medium (availability, user experience)
**Probability:** Medium
**Risk Score:** 6/10

**Mitigations:**
1. **Circuit Breakers**: Fail fast when dependencies are down, prevent cascading failures
2. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
3. **Fallback Models**: Use alternative LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4) if Anthropic down
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with cached data or smaller models
5. **Multi-Region**: Deploy across multiple cloud regions for resilience
6. **SLA Monitoring**: Track third-party uptime and escalate to vendors
7. **Data Replication**: Replicate critical data across regions

**Contingency:** Maintain list of alternative providers and migration runbooks.

---

### Medium Risks

#### Risk 6: Agent Consistency

**Description:** Different agents make conflicting decisions (e.g., tech stack in Architecture vs. Build).

**Impact:** Medium (rework, quality)
**Probability:** Low
**Risk Score:** 4/10

**Mitigations:**
- Shared context via orchestrator state
- Knowledge graph for cross-referencing decisions
- Consistency checks at gates
- Conflict resolution agent if inconsistencies detected

---

#### Risk 7: Scalability Bottlenecks

**Description:** Platform can't handle 500+ projects/month due to resource constraints.

**Impact:** Medium (growth, revenue)
**Probability:** Low
**Risk Score:** 4/10

**Mitigations:**
- Horizontal scaling for all services
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Load testing at 10x target capacity
- Database sharding and read replicas
- CDN for static assets

---

#### Risk 8: Regulatory Compliance

**Description:** GDPR, SOC2, or HIPAA violations lead to fines or customer loss.

**Impact:** High (legal, financial)
**Probability:** Low
**Risk Score:** 5/10

**Mitigations:**
- Policy engine enforces compliance rules
- Data residency controls (EU, US regions)
- Audit logs for all data access
- Regular compliance audits (SOC2 annual)
- Legal review of terms and privacy policy
