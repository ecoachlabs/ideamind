## Executive Summary

### Vision
IdeaMine is an autonomous software development platform that transforms raw ideas into production-ready applications through intelligent orchestration of AI agents, specialized tools, and rigorous quality gates. The platform automates the entire software lifecycle from ideation through general availability, reducing time-to-market from months to days while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards.

### Business Value
- **Time Reduction**: 10x faster from idea to production-ready software
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in critique, security, and compliance gates
- **Cost Efficiency**: Automated workflow reduces manual development effort by 80%
- **Consistency**: Standardized processes ensure predictable outcomes
- **Knowledge Capture**: Every decision, artifact, and pattern is recorded and reusable

### Target Market
- Early-stage startups needing rapid MVP development
- Enterprise innovation labs exploring multiple product concepts
- Development agencies managing multiple client projects
- Independent developers and makers
- Corporate R&D teams validating technical concepts

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Software development from concept to production involves numerous manual, error-prone steps:
- **Ideation gaps**: Ideas lack proper validation, use-case exploration, and business model clarity
- **Documentation overhead**: Creating comprehensive PRDs, architecture specs, and technical documentation is time-consuming
- **Quality inconsistency**: Manual testing, security checks, and code reviews are inconsistent
- **Feedback delays**: Long cycles between user feedback and fixes
- **Knowledge loss**: Decisions, patterns, and lessons learned are scattered or lost

### Pain Points
1. **Lengthy ideation-to-code cycles** (2-6 months typical)
2. **Incomplete requirements** leading to rework (30-40% of dev time)
3. **Security and compliance gaps** discovered late in cycle
4. **Manual testing bottlenecks** causing release delays
5. **Poor feedback integration** resulting in unaddressed user issues

### Opportunity
Autonomous AI agents can orchestrate end-to-end development workflows with:
- Systematic ideation, critique, and business validation
- Automated code generation with built-in quality controls
- Continuous testing, security scanning, and compliance checks
- Real-time feedback processing and automated fixes
- Complete audit trails and knowledge capture

## Product Overview

### Core Concept
IdeaMine implements a **three-layer intelligence model** orchestrated by **nine types of "doers"** that ensure every action is executed with quality, accountability, and durability.

#### Three-Layer Intelligence
1. **Orchestrators** (Conductors): Plan and sequence work across phases
2. **Agents** (Thinkers): Make decisions and delegate to tools when beneficial
3. **Tools** (Hands): Execute specialized, atomic tasks with precision

#### Nine "Doers" Architecture
1. **Orchestrators**: Sequence phases, set gates, loop on failures
2. **Agents**: Reason, plan, decide; use Analyzer-inside-Agent pattern
3. **Tools**: Perform precise, hard tasks (100+ specialized tools)
4. **Executors**: Run tools/jobs reliably in sandboxed environments
5. **Gatekeepers**: Enforce quality gates with evidence-based evaluation
6. **Triggers**: Start/resume workflows on events or schedules
7. **Supervisors**: Monitor runs, auto-restart failed steps, handle backoff
8. **Dispatchers**: Queue and route work with back-pressure management
9. **Recorders**: Log every step, decision, artifact, and cost

## Analyzer-inside-Agent Pattern

Every agent implements a five-step internal pattern:

### 1. Planner
Drafts a step-by-step plan for the assigned task based on inputs and context.

### 2. Analyzer
**Decision Logic**:
- Classify the sub-task (e.g., "diagram generation", "security scan", "API spec validation")
- Estimate self-confidence for solving without tools (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
- If confidence ≥ threshold (typically 0.78), proceed with pure reasoning
- Otherwise, query Tool Registry by capability tags
- Score tool candidates using **Value-of-Information (VoI)**:
  ```
  score = (expected_error_reduction × utility_weight) - (cost + latency_penalty + risk_penalty)
  ```
- Apply policy checks: allowlist, budget remaining, max tool calls
- Invoke best tool if max(score) ≥ threshold; otherwise continue reasoning

### 3. Executor
Runs either:
- Pure LLM reasoning to produce output directly, OR
- Tool invocation via Executor with sandboxing and timeout controls

### 4. Verifier
Checks outputs against rubrics:
- Quick quality eval (lightweight scoring)
- Compare against acceptance criteria
- Retry or escalate if quality insufficient

### 5. Recorder
Logs execution trace with:
- Inputs/outputs
- Tool usage decisions and rationale
- Costs (tokens, USD)
- Latency
- Quality scores
- Evidence links for gates

### Per-Agent Tool Policy
Each agent has a YAML policy defining:
```yaml
agent: prd-writer
budget:
  max_tool_calls: 4
  max_cost_usd: 0.75
thresholds:
  min_confidence_no_tool: 0.78
  min_score_to_invoke: 0.22
allowlist:
  - tool.prd.traceMatrix
  - tool.prd.nfrPack
  - tool.ideation.usecases
risk:
  forbid_pii: true
  network_egress: restricted
```

#### R4: Orchestration Engine Failures
**Impact**: HIGH | **Probability**: LOW

**Description**: Custom engine could have durability or scaling issues

**Mitigations**:
- Event sourcing for workflow state
- PostgreSQL replication for durability
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Chaos engineering tests
- Phased rollout with monitoring
- Fallback to manual intervention

---

#### R5: Tool Reliability
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM

**Description**: 100+ tools may fail, timeout, or produce bad outputs

**Mitigations**:
- Executors with retries + circuit breakers
- Tool approval process with smoke tests
- Verifier step validating outputs
- SLA tracking per tool
- Quarantine mechanism for failing tools
- Fallback to pure agent reasoning

---

### Medium Risks

#### R6: Scaling Challenges
**Mitigation**: Horizontal scaling design, load testing before launch, queue-based architecture

#### R7: Integration Complexity
**Mitigation**: API-first design, contract testing, staged rollouts, extensive docs

#### R8: User Adoption
**Mitigation**: Frictionless onboarding, template gallery, demos, community support

#### R9: Compliance Gaps
**Mitigation**: Legal review of generated ToS/Privacy, GDPR/CCPA flows, audit trails

**Deliverables**:
- Orchestration engine with state machine
- Intake, Ideation, Critique, PRD agents
- Gatekeeper with Critique + PRD gates
- Basic admin console
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Qdrant setup
- Event bus operational

**Demo**: Submit idea → 2 hours → Complete PRD + BizDevPack

---

### Milestone 2: BizDev + Architecture + Build (Weeks 13-20)
**Focus**: Business validation and technical planning

**Deliverables**:
- BizDev agents with viability gate
- Architecture agents with security gate
- Build agents creating repos + CI/CD
- Tool Registry with 20 tools
- Agent SDK v1.0
- Enhanced admin console

**Demo**: PRD → 1 hour → Full architecture + provisioned environments

---

### Milestone 3: Coding Loop + QA + Release (Weeks 21-30)
**Focus**: Code generation to deployable artifact

**Deliverables**:
- Story execution loop
- Test generation and QA automation
- Aesthetic layer with visual/a11y checks
- Release packaging and deployment
- Beta distribution
- 50+ tools operational

**Demo**: Architecture → 4 hours → Deployed beta to testers

---

### Milestone 4: Feedback Loop + Growth + GA (Weeks 31-38)
**Focus**: Close feedback loop and growth features

**Deliverables**:
- Feedback processing and automated fixes
- Docs generation
- Growth loops (onboarding, experiments)
- Cost optimization
- GA release process
- Full admin console with dashboards

**Demo**: Complete idea → GA journey in < 24 hours

---

### Post-Milestone: Optimization & Scale (Ongoing)
- Performance tuning
- Cost optimization
- Additional tools (community contributions)
- Multi-language support
- Enterprise features (SSO, multi-tenancy)

---

## Conclusion

IdeaMine represents a fundamental shift in software development by automating the complete lifecycle with intelligent orchestration, rigorous quality gates, and complete audit trails. By implementing the nine-doer architecture with custom orchestration, we achieve autonomy without sacrificing control, speed without sacrificing quality, and automation without sacrificing transparency.

The four-milestone roadmap provides a clear path to a production-ready system that can take ideas from concept to deployment in hours instead of months, while maintaining enterprise-grade standards for security, compliance, and observability.
